# RGS14 repository
Scripts for "Learning Fast and Slow: Increased cortical plasticity leads to memory interference and enhanced hippocampal-cortical interactions." 
doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.21.517356 

_Dependencies:_ Some scripts in the "nonrem_oscillations" folder will require the [CorticoHippocampal](https://github.com/Aleman-Z/CorticoHippocampal/) and [ADRITOOLS](https://github.com/Aleman-Z/ADRITOOLS) repositories in the path.   

The spiking activity data was generated after performing a consensus-based spike sorting with spikeinterface adapted to our OS task using [this pipeline](https://github.com/aleman-z/spikesorting).
